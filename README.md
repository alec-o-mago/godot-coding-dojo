# Godot Engine 4.0 Coding Dojo

This Dojo is focused in training programers to make their first game in Godot Engine.

## Why Godot?

- Free: Open source. No "Pro" version with extra features or sharing revenue of your game. 
- Lightweight: Way lower system requirements than Unity and Unreal.
- Fast: Node system allows quick prototyping

## Agenda:

- Review and discussion (10 minutes): Participants share their solutions and discuss the various approaches taken.
- Retrospective (5 minutes): Participants reflect on the session and provide feedback on what went well and what could be improved for future sessions.
